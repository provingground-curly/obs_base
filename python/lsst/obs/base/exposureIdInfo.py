class ExposureIdInfo(object):
    """Exposure ID and number of bits used.

    Attributes include:

    expId
        exposure ID as a long int
    expBits
        maximum number of bits allowed for exposure IDs
    maxBits
        maximum number of bits available for values that combine exposure ID
        with other information, such as source ID
    unusedBits
        maximum number of bits available for non-exposure info (maxBits - expBits)

    One common use is creating an ID factory for making a source table.
    For example, given a data butler `butler` and a data ID `dataId`::

        from lsst.afw.table import IdFactory, SourceTable
        exposureIdInfo = butler.get("expIdInfo", dataId)
        sourceIdFactory = IdFactory.makeSource(exposureIdInfo.expId, exposureIdInfo.unusedBits)
        schema = SourceTable.makeMinimalSchema()
        #...add fields to schema as desired, then...
        sourceTable = SourceTable.make(self.schema, sourceIdFactory)

    At least one bit must be reserved, even if there is no exposure ID, for reasons
    that are not entirely clear (this is DM-6664).
