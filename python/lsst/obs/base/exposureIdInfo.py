class ExposureIdInfo(object):
    """Struct representing an exposure ID and the number of bits it uses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expId : `int`
        Exposure ID.  Note that this is typically the ID of an
        `afw.image.Exposure`, not the ID of an actual observation, and hence it
        usually either includes a detector component or is derived from SkyMap
        IDs.
    expBits : `int`
        Maximum number of bits allowed for exposure IDs of this type.
    maxBits : `int`, optional
        Maximum number of bits available for values that combine exposure ID
        with other information, such as source ID.  If not provided
        (recommended when possible), `unusedBits` will be computed by assuming
        the full ID must fit an an `lsst.afw.table` RecordId field.

    One common use is creating an ID factory for making a source table.
    For example, given a data butler `butler` and a data ID `dataId`::

        from lsst.afw.table import IdFactory, SourceTable
        exposureIdInfo = butler.get("expIdInfo", dataId)
        sourceIdFactory = IdFactory.makeSource(exposureIdInfo.expId, exposureIdInfo.unusedBits)
        schema = SourceTable.makeMinimalSchema()
        #...add fields to schema as desired, then...
        sourceTable = SourceTable.make(self.schema, sourceIdFactory)

    At least one bit must be reserved, even if there is no exposure ID, for reasons
    that are not entirely clear (this is DM-6664).
